Historically St Nicholas was the bishop of Myra in western Turkey around AD 345, but he’s better known as the patron saint of children, sailors, merchants and pawnbrokers – not to mention the city of Amsterdam.</p><p>In mid- to late November the white-bearded saint, dressed as a bishop with mitre and staff, arrives in Amsterdam by steamboat from ‘Spain’ and parades down the Damrak on horseback to receive the city keys from the mayor. He is accompanied by a host of mischievous servants called Zwarte Pieten (Black Peters), Dutch helpers in blackface (or politically correct blue- or greenface) who throw sweets around and carry sacks in which to take naughty children away. Well-behaved children get presents in a shoe that they’ve placed by the fireplace with a carrot for the saint’s horse (which stays on the roof while a Black Peter climbs down the chimney).</p><p>On the evening of 5 December, people give one another anonymous and creatively wrapped gifts accompanied by funny or perceptive poems about the recipient written by Sinterklaas. The gift itself matters less than the wrapping (the greater the surprise, the better) and poetry (the more the recipient is put on the spot, the better).</p><p>The North American Santa Claus evolved from the Sinterklaas celebrations at the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam, which eventually became New York.</p></body><pois type="array" /></box-text-content><box-text-content><!--en/Introductory-Table 1.csv: Row 29--><destination><name>Amsterdam-6</name></destination><classifications><classification><name>introductory</name><classification><name>getting started</name><classification><name>sample prices</name></classification></classification></classification></classifications><sections><section><title>Getting Started</title><section><title>How Much?</title></section></section></sections><title>How Much?</title><problematic>0</problematic><body><p>Litre of bottled water: €0.57</p><p>Litre of unleaded petrol/gasoline: €1.40</p><p>Glass of Heineken: €2</p><p><em>Kroket </em>sandwich at van Dobben: €2</p><p>One hour of parking: €3.50</p><p><em>Strippenkaart </em>(15-strip ticket for public transport) : €6.80</p><p>Cinema ticket: €8</p><p>Robust bicycle lock: €13</p><p><em>Rijsttafel </em>dinner at Tujuh Maret Indonesian restaurant: €23.50</p><p>Tip in a public toilet: €0.50</p></body><pois type="array" /></box-text-content><box-text-content><!--en/Introductory-Table 1.csv: Row 17--><!--Text containing cross references needs attention--><destination><name>Amsterdam-6</name></destination><classifications><classification><name>introductory</name><classification><name>getting started</name><classification><name>advance planning</name></classification></classification></classification></classifications><sections><section><title>Getting Started</title><section><title>Advance Planning</title></section></section></sections><title>Advance Planning</title><problematic>1</problematic><body><p>Before you head to Amsterdam, note that hotels book up fast in high season or around big events like trade fairs, so try to book your accommodation well ahead of time. The hotel-booking function at www.iamsterdam.com gives a quick idea of availability on a certain date, although as with most online hotel services, not all places are listed. </p><p>Read the <em>Amsterdam Weekly </em>(www.amsterdamweekly.nl) to see what’s on in the way of festivals and special events. You might also check the sked at the RAI convention centre, which puts on interesting trade fairs. Football fans scan for matches of leading Dutch teams on www.soccerway.com. Apart from the events themselves, you’ll get clues about the crowd levels in town and the demand for hotel rooms.</p><p>Be sure to check the weather reports and tailor your activities (eg rain = museums, sun = canal-hopping). Pack layers of clothing and a raincoat, bearing in mind the Dutch weather is notoriously fickle and there can be chilly spells even in summer. </p><p>When planning to dine out it pays to reserve ahead in popular restaurants, sometimes several days ahead of time. And last but not least, take a pair of earplugs to ensure a good night’s sleep. </p></body><pois type="array" /></box-text-content><content><!--en/Introductory-Table 1.csv: Row 16--><!--Text containing map/page references needs attention--><!--Text containing cross references needs attention--><destination><name>Amsterdam-6</name></destination><classifications><classification><name>introductory</name><classification><name>getting started</name></classification></classification></classifications><sections><section><title>Getting Started</title></section></sections><title>Getting Started</title><problematic>1</problematic><body><p>Amsterdam is so incredibly well organised that you won’t need to plan ahead (much). Getting there is a cinch, the handsome canal-laced centre is compact and easy to explore, and regardless of the season there’ll be oodles of things to do. The city is extremely popular with visitors, so booking accommodation is likely to be your most demanding task. A key thing to bear in mind: while it’s possible to ‘do’ the Dutch capital on a busker’s income, you’ll breathe easier with a medium-sized wallet. </p><p>WHEN TO GO</p><p>Try as you will, there’s not really a bad time to visit Amsterdam. In any given month the festivals and celebrations will keep you going nonstop, and in a rare lull there are plenty of museums and exhibitions to hold your interest. When the weather warms up, Amsterdammers rejoice by flocking into the streets, canals and parks, and cafés happily move their seating outdoors. </p><p>The summer agenda teems with open-air concerts, theatre and festivals, often free. The party to end all orange parties is Queen’s Day on 30 April, an unforgettable experience. Major cultural events include the Holland Festival and Roots Music Festival in June, Julidans in July and the Uitmarkt in August. Outdoors enthusiasts will want to take in National Cycling Day or one of the road races throughout the year.</p><p>A few of the events listed in the following section are out of town but are worth the trip. See p246 for a list of public holidays – when the city has a tendency to shut down. Accommodation is cheapest from November to December, and can fall to ludicrously low levels in the bigger hotels in January and February. </p></body><pois type="array" /></content><content><!--en/Introductory-Table 1.csv: Row 16--><!--en/Festivals & events-Table 1.csv: Row 5--><!--en/Festivals & events-Table 1.csv: Row 11--><destination><name>Amsterdam-6</name></destination><classifications><classification><name>introductory</name><classification><name>getting started</name></classification></classification><classification><name>festivals &amp; events</name><classification><name>overview</name></classification></classification></classifications><sections><section><title>Getting Started</title><section><title>Festivals &amp; Events</title></section></section></sections><title>Festivals &amp; Events</title><problematic>0</problematic><body><p>The annual calendar is a never-ending procession of parties, exhibitions, concerts, festivals, sports challenges and other events almost without let-up during the entire year. Things slow down a little after New Year’s as the city nurses its collective head. </p></body><pois type="array" /></content><content><!--en/Introductory-Table 1.csv: Row 16--><!--en/Money & costs-Table 1.csv: Row 12--><!--en/Money & costs-Table 1.csv: Row 11--><!--Text containing map/page references needs attention--><destination><name>Amsterdam-6</name></destination><classifications><classification><name>introductory</name><classification><name>getting started</name></classification></classification><classification><name>money &amp; costs</name><classification><name>costs</name><classification><name>overview</name></classification></classification></classification></classifications><sections><section><title>Getting Started</title><section><title>Costs &amp; Money</title></section></section></sections><title>Costs &amp; Money</title><problematic>1</problematic><body><p>The cost of living is about average for a northern Europe city, but less expensive than London or Paris. If you’re coming from the UK, prices may look the same numerically but the exchange rate on the pound usually makes Amsterdam a bargain. That said, it’s disturbingly easy to spend more money than you planned on, though with a few simple measures you can stop the rot.</p><p>Accommodation will likely be your major expense. Although budget lodging can be relatively inexpensive, you’ll pay dearly for anything of quality. Booking package deals, taking advantage of internet discounts and visiting in the low season can drastically cut your hotel bill. Prices ease slightly in the budget and midrange brackets as you move away from the old centre, and though you’re slightly further away from the action, the standard of facilities tends to go up. </p><p>The majority of hostels charge around €20 to €25 for a bed, though at rock-bottom you can find digs from around €17. Budget hotels charge around €55 to €80 for a basic double. A room in a midrange hotel or B&amp;B goes for €80 to €160 for a standard double, with the average somewhere around €125. For a flashy boutique or luxury hotel, expect to pay from €160, though things start to get really comfy around €200.</p><p>As for food, you’ll find lots of cafés and restaurants with three- or four-course meals anywhere from €18 to €40, though most will be around €25 to €35, and the bill can easily be more in swanky places. You can economise by taking your main meal at lunchtime, as €5 to €10 or so will buy a daily special and a drink, and then having a snack for dinner. Self-catering is an attractive option, as delis and supermarket chains like Albert Heijn stock sandwiches and prepared meals. A consolation is the reasonable price of drinks in bars and cafés, though wine tends to be overpriced in a land of beer-lovers. </p><p>Museums can be a drain on resources at about €10 a pop for the top exhibitions, but discounts are available – see p245 for discount cards, special passes and packages. Remember that many of the summer festivals cost nothing to attend, and some cultural institutions offer free treats such as the lunchtime concerts at the Concertgebouw.</p><p>Public transport is remarkably cheap, costing from €0.90 per regular journey in the city centre using a <em>strippenkaart </em>or <em>OV-chipkaart </em>, and bicycle rental will only set you back €7 to €10 per day. If you’re looking to save money, avoid taxis! Fares vary but are generally €3.40 at the drop and another €1.94 per kilometre, and the total bill mounts quickly. Petrol (gasoline) is among the priciest in Europe at around €1.40 per litre of unleaded but, then again, you’ll hardly need a car once you’re in Amsterdam. </p><p>To sum up, budget travellers staying in hostels or cheap hotels, eating in modest restaurants and visiting a museum or two should be able to scrape by on €40 to €60 a day. Staying in midrange hotels and eating in midrange restaurants equates to €80 to €100 a person per day in peak season. From around €150 per day, you can stay in four- and five-star hotels, dine at fancy restaurants and hire a private boat, provided a few others chip in. </p></body><pois type="array" /></content><content><!--en/Introductory-Table 1.csv: Row 16--><!--en/Practical information-Table 1.csv: Row 54--><!--en/Introductory-Table 1.csv: Row 25--><!--Text containing map/page references needs attention--><destination><name>Amsterdam-6</name></destination><classifications><classification><name>introductory</name><classification><name>getting started</name><classification><name>internet resources</name></classification></classification></classification><classification><name>practical information</name><classification><name>communication</name><classification><name>internet</name></classification></classification></classification></classifications><sections><section><title>Getting Started</title><section><title>Internet Resources</title></section></section></sections><title>Internet Resources</title><problematic>1</problematic><body><p>Amsterdam is a pretty switched-on place and the web, eureka, is a fertile source of information.

You can start by keeping your ‘carbon footprint’ as small as possible (ie by taking a low-emission train to your destination, or ride-sharing by car). </p><p>The petite city centre is tailor-made for bicycles and foot traffic. Once you’re here there’s little need for a car, which anyway is more a curse than a blessing in the quaint but perennially clogged lanes of the Canal Belt. The efficient web of bus, tram and metro lines is a much better option and feeds seamlessly into the national transportat system. Amsterdam’s long-standing policy of curbing motor-vehicle use reduces not only congestion, but air pollution (electric cargo trams are being launched in 2008 for the very same reason). </p><p>Most glass bottles carry a deposit, returnable to supermarkets for a refund. Disposable bottles (both glass and plastic) can be deposited into bottle banks located around town. Recyclable paper containers are becoming more common too. </p></body><pois type="array" /></content></book-content>
